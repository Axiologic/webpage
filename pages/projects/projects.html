    <psk-chapter title="DRONEWS 2022-2023">        
         This project obtained  EU funding (Horizon Europe 2020) and aimed to create a solution that allows citizens to develop news using drones.
         Axiologic is contributing to privacy techniques and video processing using AI techniques.

    <psk-chapter title="AIRobot (2021-2022)">
            We are working on a communication solution integrating new AI techniques with decentralisation and blockchain technologies. 
        This is a new project that is in process of obtaining EU funding (EU funds managed by Romanian authorities).
         For Axiologic, this is a strategic project that tries to reuse our strong background in decentralisation or security and combine it with the strategic goal of increasing our strength in using AI technologies (optimisation of audio/video streams, emotion detection, metaverse like avatars, etc.). 
        We have built a network of researchers from universities and AI specialists from partner companies.

    <psk-chapter title="OpenDSU (2020-)">
        We are working to standardise the most important results of the PrivateSky  reserch project under the flag of the OpenDSU open source project. 
        Details on the <a href="https://www.opendsu.com">OpenDSU Site</a>
        OpenDSU is used in  esearch projects (Horison 2020) like <a href="https://pharmaledger.eu/">PharmaLedger </a> 
        and <a href="https://www.weldgalaxy.eu/"> WorldGalaxy </a>. As leaders of the OpenDSU community, Axiologic became in 2020 a supplier for <a href="https://www.novartis.com/">Novartis </a> and we are helping them in developing PharmaLedger related use cases.

    <psk-chapter title="PrivateSky (2016-2021)">
        PrivateSky research project : This project funded by the Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation (MCI) and the EU (budget around 3M Euro) (2016-2021) aims at building the next generation of executable choreographies and at implementing powerful innovations regarding secret smart contracts and communication between heterogeneous blockchains. PrivateSky is a platform for creating blockchain applications and introducing the concept of off-chain "secret smart contracts". Axiologic created the initial technology concept, and Axiologic's key people were  leading the PrivateSky research project inside the University" Alexandru Ioan Cuza" from Iasi.
        Details could be found in <a href="https://www.privatesky.xyz">PrivateSky Development Site</a> and in  <a href="https://www.github.com/privatesky">GitHub repositories</a>

    <psk-chapter title="SwarmESB (2008-2017)">
        SwarmESB research project : SwarmESB has validated the concept of using swarm communication to implement executable choreographies and the important role that cohoregraphies can play in improving privacy and confidentiality from code and software architectures. The SwarmESB project makes us a market leader in the integration technologies and micro-services architecture for node.js.

    <psk-chapter title="CryptoSeed (2017-)">
    CryptoSeed initiative  Together with APARS (Asociatia Pentru Antreprenoriat si Responsabilitate Sociala) 
        Axiologic is the initiator of a long time project of using blockchain for increasing societal resilience by crowdfunding mechanisms. 
        The main idea of the CryptoSeed decentralised crowdfunding platform is to initiate a federation of many crowdfunding sites.
        CryptoSeed aims to offer concepts about giving CryptoSeed tokens to crowdfunding backers.   Simply put, the mining of tokens will happen each time when somebody is helping a project with some money (fiat or even crypto).      As a crowdfunding backer, you do not lose your wealth; it is transformed into CryptoSeed tokens.
        Because of the problems in the Crypto industry caused by too many unscrupulous ICOs (many without existing technologies and products), 
        We also try to reposition this project for crowdfunding and self-governance within local communities.
        We plan to apply this fundamental research project to a startup/project using a new brand (we are working actively to secure funding and prepare the right team).

    <psk-chapter title="Past Projects">
        Other past projects: We have invested in researching and developing different products like Obfusc (2007), SensERP(2011), and thebuzz.center (2014). The development of these products is now stopped, our focus being on the technologies around the PrivateSky platform.
