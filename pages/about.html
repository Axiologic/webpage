<psk-page title=" About Axiologic ">

    <psk-chapter title="Contact us: projects at axiologic.net">
        Axiologic Research was founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/salboaie/">Sînică Alboaie </a> in 2003 and it is located in Iași/Romania.<br>
        Sînică has over 20 years of experience as an entrepreneur, as a software developer,  technical manager, and as a researcher in areas like distributed systems,
        software integration, privacy, and blockchain technologies.
        Sînică is currently co-leader of the architecture work package in the ambitious Pharmaledger European research project.
        He is also technically leading an innovative European project called PrivateSky that invented new privacy-enhancing technologies build around executable choreographies.
        Sînică has the hope that the digital world is going in the direction of data self-sovereignty as a guarantee for preserving and increasing our political and economic freedom.

        The team lead by Sînică in Axiologic is composed mainly of PhDs, PhD students and very experienced programmers.

    <psk-chapter title="Current focus">
        In the last years, Axiologic has  a strict focus on blockchain-based decentralized business applications.
        This focus allows us to quickly build and deploy solutions and processes on public or consortium blockchains.
        We have an experienced team of researchers and developers with experience in creating decentralized applications.
        Axiologic is a  software development company, with strong and variegated expertise in enterprise integration, privacy-enhancing technologies,
        security, blockchains, web applications and mobile software development.
        Axiologic is involved in advanced research aimed at scaling blockchain-based systems, secure digital values, storage and at doing complex integration with smart contracts
        and executable choreographies. We research, design and implement in software the business processes and the integration of project components with the distributed ledgers.
        We are specialized in doing the implementation of the industry-specific Distributed Applications and of the smart contracts.
        In PrivateSky we contributed to the development of off-chain storages, choreographic smart contracts and various types of secret smart contracts.
        Axiologic is open to transfer technologies from the PrivateSky platform towards other blockchain projects.

    <psk-chapter title="Our Offering: Blockchain Consultancy and Decentralized Applications">
        We develop decentralized applications that implement cost-efficient and secure blockchain-based business solutions.
        Based on the analysis of needs and potential benefits of migrating existing business processes to the blockchain, we build, test and deploy robust decentralized solutions.
        We develop trustless decentralized applications using smart contracts that automate business processes and deliver cost efficiency and continuity.

    <psk-chapter title="Research collaborations">
        We could create for you a custom solution based on private or public blockchains, combining off-chain components with on-chain smart contracts.
        For many years we have done consultancy for companies from UK, Germany, US and Romania.
        We have started with C/C++/Java/PHP/Node.js more than 15 years ago but now we are looking mostly to collaborate on big research projects about blockchains and integrations (for example Lightweight ESBs).

    <psk-chapter title="Security and Privacy">
    We build extensive cyber-threat protection and security monitoring into our solution architectures.
        Our solutions are GDPR-compliant and protect user identities and data using public-key cryptography and privacy-by-design methodologies.
        Our researchers have a deep understanding of the security attack models and of cryptography.
       Our 10-year experience with SwarmESB and the new generation of technologies that use the swarm executable choreographies in PrivateSky recommends
        us to provide effective solutions for complex projects that have grown to the level where a rewrite or architectural refactoring is needed.
