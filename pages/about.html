<psk-page title=" About Axiologic ">

    <psk-chapter title="Current focus">
    In the last years, Axiologic has  a strict focus on blockchain-based decentralized business applications.
    This focus allows us to quickly build and deploy solutions and processes on public or consortium blockchains.
    We have an experienced team of researchers and developers with experience in creating decentralized applications.

    <psk-chapter title="Our Offering: Blockchain Consultancy and Decentralized Applications">
        We develop decentralized applications that implement cost-efficient and secure blockchain-based business solutions.
        Based on the analysis of needs and potential benefits of migrating existing business processes to the blockchain, we build, test and deploy robust decentralized solutions.
        We develop trustless decentralized applications using smart contracts that automate business processes and deliver cost efficiency and continuity.

    <psk-chapter title="Research collaborations">
        We could create for you a custom solution based on private or public blockchains, combining off-chain components with on-chain smart contracts.
        For many years we have done consultancy for companies from UK, Germany, US and Romania.
        We have started with C/C++/Java/PHP/Node.js 15 years ago but now we are looking mostly to collaborate on big projects around integration (Lightweight ESBs)
        and custom blockchains technologies as well as research in blockchain, privacy, cryptography, security.

    <psk-chapter title="Security and Privacy">

    We build extensive cyber-threat protection and security monitoring into our solution architectures. Our solutions are GDPR-compliant and protect user identities and data using public-key cryptography and privacy-by-design methodologies. Our researchers have a deep understanding of the security attack models and of cryptography.
    Our 10-year experience with SwarmESB and the new generation of technologies that use the swarm executable choreographies in PrivateSky recommends us to provide effective solutions for complex projects that have grown to the level where a rewrite or architectural refactoring is needed.
