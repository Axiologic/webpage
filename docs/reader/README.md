# Axiologic Reader resources

The reader is opened at `/reader/` and receives its edition in the query string. It selects the most adaptable available source in this order: **HTML**, **EPUB**, then **PDF**. An audio file is offered alongside the reading edition whenever one is available.

## Preferred convention

Keep source and generated files in their language directories, with the same basename:

```text
content/RO/Four_Realities_RO.pdf
content/RO/Four_Realities_RO.epub
content/htmls/RO/Four_Realities_RO.html
content/RO/Four_Realities_RO.mp3
```

Book pages pass the generated HTML URL explicitly because it lives under `content/htmls/`. The reader can still infer `.epub`, `.m4a`, `.mp3` and `.ogg` alternatives from the PDF URL. Every file must be served from the same origin.

For files whose names differ, use explicit parameters (all URLs must be URL-encoded):

```text
/reader/?id=four-realities-ro&title=Patru%20Realit%C4%83%C8%9Bi&html=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fbook.html&epub=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fbook.epub&pdf=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fbook.pdf&audio=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fbook.m4a
```

`id` is the durable identity used for saved reading progress. Use a distinct id for every language and edition, for example `four-realities-ro-2026`.

The reader stores only position and display preferences in browser `localStorage`: PDF page, EPUB CFI, HTML scroll percentage, audio time, type size and theme. It never uploads reading history.
