				<h2>
					Axiologic has had a <span>strong focus </span> on
					blockchain-based decentralized business application
					in the last few years
				</h2>
				<div>
					<p class="truncate 23">
						Recently we have added AI techniques to our shortlist of strategic competencies we aim to expand. This focus allows us to quickly build
						and deploy solutions and processes on public or consortium blockchains. We have an experienced team of researchers and developers with experience in creating
						decentralized applications. Axiologic is a software development company with variegated and robust expertise in enterprise integration, privacy-enhancing
						technologies, security, blockchains, web applications and mobile software development. Axiologic is involved in advanced research to scale blockchain-based
						systems, secure digital values storage, and do complex integration with smart contracts and executable choreographies. We research, design, and implement
						the business processes in software and the integration of project components with the distributed ledgers. We are specialized in implementing industry-specific
						Distributed Applications and smart contracts. In PrivateSky, our team developed off-chain storage technologies, new types of blockchains and smart-contracts.
						Axiologic is open to transferring technologies from the PrivateSky platform towards other blockchain projects.

					<h4>Research Collaborations</h4>
					<div>
						<p class="truncate 20">
							We could create a custom solution based on AI techniques, private or public blockchains,
							combining off-chain components with on-chain smart-contracts. For many years we have done
							consultancy for companies from UK, Germany, US and Romania. We started with C/C++/Java/PHP/Node.js
							more than 15 years ago. Still, now we are mainly looking to collaborate on significant research
							projects about AI, blockchains and complex integrations (e.g. Digital Trust Ecosystems for entire industries ).

						<p class="truncate 12">
							We develop decentralized applications that implement cost-efficient and secure blockchain-based business solutions.
							Based on the analysis of needs and potential benefits of migrating existing business processes to the blockch ain,
							we build, test and deploy robust decentralized solutions. We develop trustless decentralized applications using
							smart contracts that automate business processes and deliver cost efficiency and continuity.

					<h4>Security and Privacy</h4>
					<div>
						<p class="truncate 19">
							We have built extensive cyber-threat protection and security monitoring into our past solutions. Our solutions are
							GDPR-compliant and protect user identities and data using advanced cryptography (Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Homomorphic
							Encryption), public-key cryptography and privacy-by-design methodologies. Our researchers have a deep understanding
							of the security attack models and cryptography. More than 10-years of experience with SwarmESB and PrivateSky recommends
							that we provide practical solutions for complex projects that require complex rewrites or architectural refactoring.
