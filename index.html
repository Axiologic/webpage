						decentralized applications. Axiologic is a software development company with variegated and robust expertise in enterprise integration, privacy-enhancing
						technologies, security, blockchains, web applications and mobile software development. Axiologic is involved in advanced research to scale blockchain-based
						systems, secure digital values storage, and do complex integration with smart contracts and executable choreographies. We research, design, and implement
						the business processes in software and the integration of project components with the distributed ledgers. We are specialized in implementing industry-specific
						Distributed Applications and smart contracts. In PrivateSky, our team developed off-chain storage technologies, new types of blockchains and smart-contracts.
						Axiologic is open to transferring technologies from the PrivateSky platform towards other blockchain projects.

					<p class="truncate" data-length="30">
						CryptoSeed initiative Together with APARS (Asociatia Pentru Antreprenoriat si Responsabilitate Sociala) Axiologic
						is the initiator of a long time project of using blockchain for increasing societal resilience by crowdfunding
						mechanisms. The main idea of the CryptoSeed decentralised crowdfunding platform is to initiate a federation of many
						crowdfunding sites. CryptoSeed aims to offer concepts about giving CryptoSeed tokens to crowdfunding backers.
						Simply put, the mining of tokens will happen each time when somebody is helping a project with some money (fiat
						or even crypto). As a crowdfunding backer, you do not lose your wealth; it is transformed into CryptoSeed tokens.
						Because of the problems in the Crypto industry caused by too many unscrupulous ICOs (many without existing technologies
						and products), We also try to reposition this project for crowdfunding and self-governance within local communities.
						We plan to apply this fundamental research project to a startup/project using a new brand (we are working actively
						to secure funding and prepare the right team).
