                PrivateSky serves as a platform for building blockchain applications, pioneering the concept of
                off-chain
                "secret smart contracts". Axiologic conceived the initial technology concept, and key members of
                Axiologic
                led the PrivateSky research project within "Alexandru Ioan Cuza" University of Iași.
                The outcomes of this project are now maintained and further developed by Axiologic under the OpenDSU
                technology.

                SwarmESB Research Project validated the concept of using swarm communication to implement executable
                choreographies
                and demonstrated the critical role of choreographies in enhancing privacy and confidentiality within
                software architectures.
                More details are available in the <a href="https://github.com/salboaie/swarmesb">GitHub repository</a>.
                Although the technologies and innovations from SwarmESB have not yet reached mainstream adoption, we
                believe that
                as the number of autonomous AI agents interacting with each other increases, the SwarmESB approach and
                the concept
                of executable choreography will inevitably replace traditional agent orchestration.
                This shift will enable a more flexible and security/privacy-friendly model, making interactions easier
                to analyze and adapt to evolving needs.
