						<h1>About Axiologic</h1>
						<p>Axiologic Research was founded by Sînică Alboaie in 2003 and it is located in Iași/Romania.
							Sînică has over 20 years of experience as an entrepreneur, software developer, technical manager, and researcher in areas like distributed systems,
							software integration, privacy, and blockchain technologies. Sînică is currently co-leader of the architecture work package in the ambitious
							Pharmaledger European research project. He was also technically leading an innovative European project called PrivateSky that invented new
							privacy-enhancing technologies built around executable choreographies. Sînică has the hope that the digital world is going in the direction
							of data self-sovereignty as a guarantee for preserving and increasing our political and economic freedom. The team led by Sînică in Axiologic
							is composed mainly of PhDs, PhD students and very experienced programmers.

						<h1>Current Focus</h1>
						<p>Axiologic has had a strong focus on blockchain-based decentralized business applications in the last few years. Recently we have added AI techniques
							to our shortlist of strategic competencies we aim to expand. This focus allows us to quickly build and deploy solutions and processes on public or
							consortium blockchains. We have an experienced team of researchers and developers with experience in creating decentralized applications. Axiologic
							is a software development company with variegated and robust expertise in enterprise integration, privacy-enhancing technologies, security, blockchains,
							web applications and mobile software development. Axiologic is involved in advanced research to scale blockchain-based systems, secure digital values
							storage, and do complex integration with smart contracts and executable choreographies. We research, design, and implement the business processes in
							software and the integration of project components with the distributed ledgers. We are specialized in implementing industry-specific Distributed
							Applications and smart contracts. In PrivateSky, our team developed off-chain storage technologies, new types of blockchains and smart-contracts.
							Axiologic is open to transferring technologies from the PrivateSky platform towards other blockchain projects.

						<h2>Research Collaborations</h2>
						<p>We could create a custom solution based on AI techniques, private or public blockchains, combining off-chain components with on-chain smart-contracts.
							For many years we have done consultancy for companies from UK, Germany, US and Romania. We started with C/C++/Java/PHP/Node.js more than 15 years ago.
							Still, now we are mainly looking to collaborate on significant research projects about AI, blockchains and complex integrations (e.g. Digital Trust
							Ecosystems for entire industries ).

						<h2>Blockchain Consultancy and Decentralized Applications</h2>
						<p>We develop decentralized applications that implement cost-efficient and secure blockchain-based business solutions. Based on the analysis of
							needs and potential benefits of migrating existing business processes to the blockchain, we build, test and deploy robust decentralized
							solutions. We develop trustless decentralized applications using smart contracts that automate business processes and deliver cost efficiency
							and continuity.

						<h2>Security and Privacy</h2>
						<p>We have built extensive cyber-threat protection and security monitoring into our past solutions. Our solutions are GDPR-compliant and protect
							user identities and data using advanced cryptography (Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Homomorphic Encryption), public-key cryptography and privacy-by-design
							methodologies. Our researchers have a deep understanding of the security attack models and cryptography. More than 10-years of experience with
							SwarmESB and PrivateSky recommends that we provide practical solutions for complex projects that require complex rewrites or architectural refactoring.
