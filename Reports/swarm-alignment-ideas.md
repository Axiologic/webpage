The following tables organize the ideas by their relevant disciplines, providing a structured overview of how each field contributes to the conceptualization of limitations and dynamics within multi-agent systems.

### Biology
| Idea | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Energy Consumption Limits | Agents have energy budgets that limit their processing capabilities, similar to metabolic rates in biological organisms. |
| Evolutionary Pressures | Agents evolve through natural selection, with only the most efficient surviving and propagating. |
| Population Dynamics | The number of agents fluctuates based on resources and interactions, akin to biological ecosystems. |
| Ageing and Obsolescence | Introduce ageing concepts, where agents become less efficient or obsolete over time. |
| Resource Depletion and Sustainability | Agents manage resources to avoid depletion and ensure sustainability, reflecting environmental science concerns. |

### Economics
| Idea | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Resource Allocation Constraints | Agents compete for limited resources, incentivizing efficient use. |
| Market Mechanisms | Task allocation among agents uses market-based mechanisms with tasks having varying rewards. |
| Specialization and Trade | Agents specialize and trade outputs, reflecting economic principles of comparative advantage. |
| Economic Inequality | Variability in agents' access to resources simulates economic inequality. |
| Economic Bubbles and Crashes | Collective behaviours can lead to economic bubbles and subsequent crashes. |

### Politics
| Idea | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Democratic Decision Making | Agents participate in decision-making through voting, reflecting democratic governance systems. |
| Legal Regulations | Introduce legal frameworks that agents must adhere to, mimicking societal laws. |
| Political Power Dynamics | Agents form groups that wield varying degrees of power, akin to political parties or nations. |
| International Relations | Agents engage in diplomacy or conflict, mirroring geopolitical strategies. |

### Sociology
| Idea | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Social Hierarchies | Agents are organized in hierarchies with tiered access to information. |
| Cultural Norms | Agents develop cultural norms that guide interactions and strategies. |
| Trust and Reputation Systems | Develop trust and reputation metrics for agents. |
| Conflict and Cooperation | Agents face dilemmas related to conflict and cooperation. |
| Social Influence and Peer Pressure | Agents are influenced by the actions and opinions of their peers. |
| Norms and Taboos | Establish social norms and taboos that guide or restrict agent behaviour. |
| Social Mobility | Agents have opportunities for social mobility. |

### Cognitive Science/Psychology
| Idea | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Memory Constraints | Limit agents' memory capacity, requiring prioritization of information retention. |
| Adaptation and Learning Limits | Agents adapt or learn within bounded rationality. |
| Innovation and Creativity Limits | Agents have constraints on their ability to innovate or create. |
| Cognitive Load | Implement cognitive load limitations on agents. |
| Collective Intelligence | The system harnesses collective intelligence for problem-solving. |

### Other Disciplines
| Idea | Description | Discipline |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Communication Barriers | Agents experience understanding limitations due to varying communication protocols. | Linguistics |
| Ethical Constraints | Embed ethical considerations into agents' decision-making. | Philosophy |
| Feedback Loops | Introduce feedback loops that influence agent behaviours and system stability. | Systems Theory |
| Ecosystem Services | Some agents perform essential roles for the system's health. | Ecology |
| Urban Dynamics | Model agent interactions and resource flows on urban dynamics. | Urban Studies |
| Historical Path Dependency | Agents' development is influenced by their historical paths. | History |
| Disaster Response and Resilience | Agents respond to disruptions, testing system resilience. | Emergency Management |
| Moral Dilemmas | Agents face moral dilemmas requiring tough choices. | Ethics |
| Emotional Intelligence | Equip agents with the ability to respond to others' emotional states. | Psychology |
| Linguistic Diversity | Incorporate linguistic diversity and translation challenges. | Linguistics |
