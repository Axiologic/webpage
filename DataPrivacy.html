Record-keeping</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;process </span></h1><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4">To initiate the comprehensive management of data processing activities, Axiologic begins by creating a continuously updated record as processes change or are added. The processed data is then classified as Customer, Employee, Vendor, and Sensitive. Specific processing activities are documented for each data category, including collection, storage, access, modification, and deletion. Each activity is associated with an individual or department responsible for the processing, clearly identifying data processors.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4">For all processing activities, Axiologic documents the legal basis under which they are conducted, referencing the relevant applicable laws or regulations. Concurrently, risks associated with each processing activity to data subjects are evaluated and recorded, followed by noting the security measures in place for each data category and how they are designed to mitigate the identified risks. Data transfers, including cross-border transfers, are recorded with specificity, indicating the recipient and legal safeguards involved.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4">An essential part of this process is the logging of data retention periods. For each data category, Axiologic notes the period for which the data will be stored or the criteria used to determine that period. Regular reviews of the record are scheduled and conducted to ensure it remains up-to-date and reflects current practices. Periodic internal audits of the processing activities record are implemented for accuracy and completeness, and relevant staff members are trained to maintain the record and understand the importance of this responsibility.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4">A standardised report from the record summarises the processing activities clearly and concisely. By default, this record, or processing activities journal, is considered an internal and confidential company document. However, when acting as a vendor, Axiologic may, upon request and at its discretion, offer this journal to customers to demonstrate its data processing practices and compliance.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4">Access to the processing activities journal is strictly controlled and restricted to authorised personnel within the company. In the case of a data breach or incident, the journal is updated to include details of the incident and actions taken in response. Regular consultation with legal counsel ensures the record meets all regulatory requirements and obligations. Before finalising, the record undergoes senior management review for sign-off to validate its completeness and accuracy. Ultimately, this journal serves as a tool to assure customers of Axiologic&rsquo;s steadfast commitment to data protection and compliance with relevant regulations when acting as a vendor.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c9"></span></p><h1 class="c14 c12" id="h.b7h8mbjggb67"><span>7. </span><span>Employee onboarding process</span></h1><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4">New hires undergo an extensive initial training program at the commencement of the Employee Onboarding Process at Axiologic Research. This foundational training will equip them with essential knowledge about the company&rsquo;s policies, processes, and tools, particularly on Data Privacy Management Obligations. They are familiar with Axiologic&#39;s approach to data privacy, including understanding the various categories of data processed by the company and their responsibilities in managing this data securely and legally.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4">One of the key aspects of this initial training is a detailed walkthrough of the Data Privacy Management Obligations document. This ensures that employees understand the critical importance of data privacy from the very outset of their tenure and educates them on the practical implications of these obligations in their daily work. New hires must acknowledge receipt and understanding of this document, affirming their commitment to upholding these standards in all professional conduct.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4">To ensure that employees&rsquo; knowledge remains current and comprehensive, ongoing training is conducted in response to any changes in the Data Privacy Management Obligations document. This entails timely communication of updates to all staff members, followed by dedicated training sessions explaining the nature of the changes, the rationale behind them, and the practical steps employees must take to align with these updates.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4">In addition to these structured training modules, Axiologic maintains a robust culture of continuous learning through its weekly internal training and code review sessions. These sessions, often led by experienced team members or external experts, cover many topics, with frequent emphases on security and privacy. These weekly meetings serve multiple purposes: they reinforce the company&#39;s commitment to best practices in security and privacy, promote a culture of peer review and collaborative learning, and ensure that the entire team remains informed of the latest trends, threats, and best practices in the rapidly evolving fields of data security and privacy.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4">Moreover, these weekly sessions are not merely informational; they are interactive and designed to be practical. Employees are encouraged to ask questions, share experiences, and propose solutions, fostering an environment where learning is a shared responsibility and security and privacy are seen not as checkboxes but as integral to the company&rsquo;s operations and reputation.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4">This continuous loop of initial training, adaptive learning due to changes in critical documents, and ongoing, focused weekly sessions ensures that every Axiologic Research employee, from the newest hire to the most seasoned veteran, is not only aware of their responsibilities concerning data privacy but is also equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to execute those responsibilities effectively.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4">All Axiologic Research employees must sign the documents mandated by Romanian and European employment legislation when hiring. This includes internal regulations, such as the company&rsquo;s internal order regulations, and various declarations that reflect their legal responsibilities as employees. These documents outline the rules and expectations governing workplace behaviour, data handling practices, and general employment conditions, ensuring that all parties know their rights and obligations from the outset. The act of signing these documents is a formal acknowledgement by the employees of their understanding and acceptance of these terms and their commitment to upholding the legal and ethical standards set forth by Axiologic Research in alignment with national and international regulations.</span></p><p class="c3 c6 c7"><span class="c4"></span></p><h1 class="c14 c12" id="h.4kif1esdu1q"><span>8</span><span class="c8">. Data Privacy Frameworks &amp; Timelines</span></h1><p class="c3 c6"><span>As of August 2023, the &quot;Data Privacy Management Obligations&quot; document has been officially approved by the leadership of Axiologic Research. In alignment with this pivotal step, the company has concurrently implemented a comprehensive suite of Data Privacy frameworks meticulously designed to operationalise, enhance, and uphold the principles and requirements articulated within this pivotal document. This initiative underscores the company&rsquo;s unwavering commitment to establishing a robust, compliant, and transparent data protection environment in all its operations.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c24">Axiologic Research has strategically implemented three robust Data Privacy frameworks within its organisation, aligning its operations with the highest data protection standards. First, a comprehensive employee training program is designed to educate and continually update the workforce on data privacy principles and best practices, ensuring that all team members can handle sensitive information responsibly and securely. Second, Axiologic maintains a detailed and secure journal to systematically record all relevant data processing activities. While internal to the company by default, this journal can be made available to customers when Axiologic acts as a vendor, promoting transparency and accountability. Third, the company has appointed a dedicated Data Privacy Officer (DPO), as mandated by GDPR. The DPO, who by default is the Axiologic Research Administrator but can delegate responsibilities through an internal decision, serves as the focal point for all data protection activities, ensuring steadfast compliance with GDPR and other relevant data protection laws and acting as the liaison between the company and regulatory authorities. Axiologic Research exemplifies a deep-rooted commitment to data privacy through these three frameworks, making it a core aspect of its organisational culture and business operations.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c14 c12 c19" id="h.ur0sextc35y8"><span class="c8"></span></h1><h1 class="c14 c12" id="h.i0jzw676d134"><span>9</span><span class="c8">: Conclusions and Summary</span></h1><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4">In the current context, where personal data protection is a global and essential concern, Axiologic Research assumes a proactive role in the field by implementing a rigorous and proactive approach to compliance with data protection standards.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4">The &quot;Data Privacy Management Obligations&quot; document is the backbone of the company&#39;s commitment to data protection. It details the internal processes and policies that ensure compliance with Romanian and European data protection legislation and information security and integrity standards.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4">Axiologic Research emphasises employees&#39; initial data security and protection training as part of the onboarding process. It continues this commitment through periodic training and code reviews, focusing on safety and confidentiality.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4">All employees must also sign the necessary documents, following Romanian and European legislation when hiring. These documents, which include internal order regulations and various declarations, highlight employees&#39; legal responsibilities and are a fundamental part of the culture of integrity and compliance promoted by Axiologic.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4">In conclusion, Axiologic Research demonstrates its deep and ongoing commitment to promoting a work environment that respects and protects personal data, ensuring that its activities remain following the highest ethical and legal standards.
